Language: Python
Created a naive Bayes text classifier (nblearn.py, nbclassify.py) and compared accuracy with two popular machine learning toolkits. Worked with two datasets (emails and IMDB reviews) and performed binary classification: SPAM or HAM (not spam), and POSITIVE or NEGATIVE (sentiment analysis). Compared three machine learning techniques for making these classifications: naive Bayes classification, maximum entropy modeling, and support vector machines (MegaM and SVM-Light).
